# Disk Scheduling Algorithm Visualization

A web-based project that visualizes various **Disk Scheduling Algorithms** used in Operating Systems.  
The application is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, where JavaScript handles the algorithm logic and animations for disk head movement.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to help students understand how different disk scheduling algorithms work by visually simulating disk head movements and calculating seek time.

---

## ✨ Features

- Interactive disk head movement visualization
- Multiple disk scheduling algorithms implemented
- Real-time animation using JavaScript
- Displays seek sequence and total seek time
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Runs directly in the browser (no installation required)

---

## 🧠 Disk Scheduling Algorithms Implemented

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)
- SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
- C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the application  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Algorithm logic and visualization  
- **DOM Manipulation / Canvas** – Disk head animation

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User inputs:
   - Disk size  
   - Initial head position  
   - Disk request queue  
2. User selects a disk scheduling algorithm  
3. JavaScript processes the request queue  
4. Disk head movement is animated step-by-step  
5. Total seek time and seek sequence are displayed
